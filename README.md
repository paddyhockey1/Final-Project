### Internal links for members of coaching staff.

For the coaching team, I have included seperate internal links to custom pages that contain an image, information and a biographical paragraph. I have created these pages for six members of the coaching staff.

### Standings for both the NHL Western Conference and NHL Pacific Division.

#### Pacific Division
The standings page will provide the user with the final standings for the Facific Divison. The Pacific Division Standings page also includes a small icon of the team's logo along with their rank within the division. These standings will include a brief statistical breakdown for each team withinn the division including: games played, wins, losses, overtime losses, and points. There are further statistics for both goals for and goals against in desktop and tablet. These statistics have had to be removed from mobile for space saving reasons

#### Western Conference

The page also contains the same statistical breakdown for the wider Western Conference. Team rankings and logos have also been included for clarity. As this includes both the Pacific and Central Divisons it will give the user a greater idea og how Pacific Divsion teams, including the Ducks, fared within the entire conference.

### Future Features

I would like to include a history page. This would detail the team's entire history from 1993. It would also include some of the team's greatest players and statistical breakdowns of past seasons.

A more detailed roster page with internal links for each member of the roster. This would include statistics and a brief biography along with transaction history and contract information.

A gallery of games and team events. This could inlude images form games along with fan events and the team's charitable endeavours. Video could be added for game hightlights and post-game interviews. 

The inclusion of a contact page would allow more interaction with the user. Should the user wish to make contact, a variety of contact options would be available to them to make contact.

A page with more information of the team's home arena. This would include ticket information, a map of the arena, a guide to local hotels and atractions, and local transport links. There could also be an option for n external link to the Honda Center website. 

A page that would allow visitors of the page to interact with each other. A forum or message board would provide this option.
